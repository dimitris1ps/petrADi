Tables spill out beside the waves, shaded by tamarisk trees, as the scent of grilled octopus and fried zucchini flowers floats through the air. Locals, day-trippers, and loyal regulars come not just for the honest, flavorful food, but for the warmth of Paris and his team, who treat every guest like family. Come for the stuffed blossoms and stay for the sea breeze, ouzo clinks, and free fruit at the end — it’s the kind of place you’ll want to return to before you’ve even left."
